Key Questions:

+ **When and how did the first galaxies form?**
+ **How do galaxies build their structures over cosmic time?**
+ **When the bulge and disk components form and how they evolve over cosmic time?**
+ **When did the first galaxies cease their star formation (quenching)?**
+ **What drives the quenching in galaxies?**

I am an observational astronomer working to answer these fundamental questions about galaxy evolution. My research focuses on understanding how galaxies transform from the chaotic, clumpy structures we see in the early universe into the well-organized systems we observe today. By examining the detailed internal structures of galaxies across cosmic time, we can uncover the physical processes driving their evolution.

To tackle these challenges, I developed piXedfit, a public software package that maps out the distribution of stellar populations within galaxies. This tool has become particularly valuable with the revolutionary capabilities of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which provides unprecedented views of distant galaxies. Using piXedfit, I've revealed evidence for inside-out growth and quenching in galaxies, showing how they built their structures gradually from their centers outward. Recently, I achieved the first direct measurement of gas density in a galaxy seen just 500 million years after the Big Bang, providing crucial insights into conditions in the early universe.

Currently, I'm leading several exciting projects. Within the Euclid space telescope collaboration, I'm developing a pipeline for analyzing the internal structures of nearby galaxies. This work combines Euclid data with ground-based telescopes like the upcoming Rubin Observatory to study over 100,000 galaxies in unprecedented detail. I'm also analyzing JWST observations of distant galaxies across multiple deep fields, including COSMOS and GOODS, to understand how galaxies evolved in the early universe.

My future research will harness the combined power of JWST, Euclid, and other telescopes to create detailed maps of stellar properties in galaxies throughout cosmic history. I'm particularly focused on understanding how early star-forming regions contributed to galaxy evolution and how different environments influenced galaxy development. By comparing these observations with state-of-the-art cosmological simulations, we're piecing together the story of how galaxies like our Milky Way came to be, helping us understand our cosmic origins and the fundamental processes that shape our universe.
