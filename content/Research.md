Key Questions:

+ **When and how did the first galaxies form?**
+ **How do galaxies build their structures over cosmic time?**
+ **When the bulge and disk components form and how they evolve over cosmic time?**
+ **When did the first galaxies cease their star formation (quenching) and what drive the process?**

I am an observational astronomer investigating these fundamental questions about galaxy evolution. My research explores how galaxies form in the early universe and evolve throughout cosmic time, during which they transform from chaotic, clumpy structures into the well-defined systems (spiral and elliptical galaxies) we observe in the present-day universe. By examining galaxies' detailed internal structures across cosmic history, we can uncover the physical processes driving their evolution.

I approach this challenge by developing and applying innovative techniques for analyzing galaxies' spatially resolved properties. I developed [piXedfit](https://github.com/aabdurrouf/piXedfit), a public software package that maps the spatial distribution of stellar population properties within galaxies. This tool has become particularly valuable given the abundance of deep, high-resolution imaging data from established observatories like the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and new facilities like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Euclid, which provide unprecedented detailed views of distant galaxies.

Gaze into this deep portrait of our cosmos, where each point of light tells a story spanning billions of years. This vast cosmic tapestry serves as a time machine, capturing galaxies frozen in different chapters of our universe's evolution. In the foreground, we see mature galaxies with their graceful spiral arms and stately elliptical forms, while deeper in the field, more distant galaxies appear smaller and redder, their light having traveled billions of light-years to reach us. This single frame, containing thousands of galaxies at different distances, offers a precious scientific time capsule that allows astronomers to piece together the grand story of galactic evolution, revealing how today's intricate and ordered galaxies emerged from the chaos of the early universe.

Unlike observations that give us static snapshots of different galaxies at various cosmic epochs, simulations like IllustrisTNG TNG50 (see movie above) reveal the intricate dance of dark matter, gas, stars, and supermassive black holes across time. These digital laboratories recreate billions of years of cosmic evolution, showing us how the first primitive galaxies emerged from cosmic filaments of dark matter and gas, and how they transformed into the magnificent structures we see today. This virtual universe serves as a crucial bridge between theory and observation, allowing us to test our understanding of fundamental physics against the real cosmos. When simulation predictions match observational data, we gain confidence in our understanding; when they differ, these discrepancies point us toward new physics yet to be discovered. By comparing these simulated galaxies with our observations across cosmic time, we can unravel the complex physics driving galaxy evolution and piece together the complete story of how galaxies like our Milky Way came to be.
