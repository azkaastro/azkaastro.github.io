summary: "We investigate the relation between star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass (M*) at the sub-galactic scale (∼1 kpc) of 93 local (0.01 < z < 0.02) massive (M* > 1010.5 M⊙) spiral galaxies. To derive a spatially resolved SFR and stellar mass, we perform the so-called pixel-to-pixel spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, which fits an observed spatially resolved multiband SED with a library of model SEDs using Bayesian statistics. We use two bands (far-ultraviolet or FUV and near-ultraviolet or NUV) and five bands (u, g, r, I and z) of imaging data from Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), respectively. We find a tight nearly linear relation between the local surface density of SFR (ΣSFR) and stellar mass (Σ*), which is flattened at high Σ*. The near linear relation between Σ* and ΣSFR suggests a constant specific SFR (sSFR) throughout the galaxies, and the scatter of the relation is directly related to that of the sSFR. Therefore, we analyse the variation of the sSFR in various scales. More massive galaxies on average have lower sSFR throughout them than less massive galaxies. We also find that barred galaxies have a lower sSFR in the core region than non-barred galaxies. However, in the outer region, the sSFRs of barred and non-barred galaxies are similar and lead to a similar total sSFR."

##### Abstract

We investigate the relation between star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass (M*) at the sub-galactic scale (∼1 kpc) of 93 local (0.01 < z < 0.02) massive (M* > 1010.5 M⊙) spiral galaxies. To derive a spatially resolved SFR and stellar mass, we perform the so-called pixel-to-pixel spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, which fits an observed spatially resolved multiband SED with a library of model SEDs using Bayesian statistics. We use two bands (far-ultraviolet or FUV and near-ultraviolet or NUV) and five bands (u, g, r, I and z) of imaging data from Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), respectively. We find a tight nearly linear relation between the local surface density of SFR (ΣSFR) and stellar mass (Σ*), which is flattened at high Σ*. The near linear relation between Σ* and ΣSFR suggests a constant specific SFR (sSFR) throughout the galaxies, and the scatter of the relation is directly related to that of the sSFR. Therefore, we analyse the variation of the sSFR in various scales. More massive galaxies on average have lower sSFR throughout them than less massive galaxies. We also find that barred galaxies have a lower sSFR in the core region than non-barred galaxies. However, in the outer region, the sSFRs of barred and non-barred galaxies are similar and lead to a similar total sSFR.
