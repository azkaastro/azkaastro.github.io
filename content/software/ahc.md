summary: "Accurate Hijri Calculator (AHC) is a software for calculating the position and visibility of the crescent moon at the sunset time after the conjunction (ijtima'/new moon phase) that marks the beginning of a new month in the Islamic lunar calendar (Hijri calendar). This tool is intended for helping moslem people in estimating the start of a new Hijri month, making a calendar for coming years, comparing among the criteria of Hijri calendar, as well as educating people about the current issues regarding the Hijri calendar. This software incorporates various crescent visibility criteria currently adopted by moslem organizations around the world. AHC was firt developed in 2012 and was published at the website of the Physics Department of Brawijaya University. While the first version of AHC was built with GUI support from Delphi, now it is transformed into fully python package and can be executed on terminal (linux and windows) without GUI display. One can run AHC on Jupyter notebook to get GUI experience as shown in the example tutorial [here](https://github.com/accuhijri/ahc/blob/main/examples/ahc_1444_syawal.ipynb)."

##### Abstract

"Accurate Hijri Calculator (AHC) is a software for calculating the position and visibility of the crescent moon at the sunset time after the conjunction (ijtima'/new moon phase) that marks the beginning of a new month in the Islamic lunar calendar (Hijri calendar). This tool is intended for helping moslem people in estimating the start of a new Hijri month, making a calendar for coming years, comparing among the criteria of Hijri calendar, as well as educating people about the current issues regarding the Hijri calendar. This software incorporates various crescent visibility criteria currently adopted by moslem organizations around the world. AHC was firt developed in 2012 and was published at the website of the Physics Department of Brawijaya University. While the first version of AHC was built with GUI support from Delphi, now it is transformed into fully python package and can be executed on terminal (linux and windows) without GUI display. One can run AHC on Jupyter notebook to get GUI experience as shown in the example tutorial [here](https://github.com/accuhijri/ahc/blob/main/examples/ahc_1444_syawal.ipynb)."
