Key Questions:

+ **When and how did the first galaxies form?**
+ **How do galaxies build their structures over cosmic time?**
+ **When the bulge and disk components form and how they evolve over cosmic time?**
+ **When did the first galaxies cease their star formation (quenching) and what drive the process?**

I am an observational astronomer investigating these fundamental questions about galaxy evolution. My research explores how galaxies form in the early universe and evolve throughout cosmic time, during which they transform from chaotic, clumpy structures into the well-defined systems (spiral and elliptical galaxies) we observe in the present-day universe. By examining galaxies' detailed internal structures across cosmic history, we can uncover the physical processes driving their evolution.

I approach this challenge by developing and applying innovative techniques for analyzing galaxies' spatially resolved properties. I developed [**piXedfit**,](https://github.com/aabdurrouf/piXedfit) a public software package that maps the spatial distribution of stellar population properties within galaxies. This tool has become particularly valuable given the abundance of deep, high-resolution imaging data from established observatories like the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and new facilities like the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and Euclid, which provide unprecedented detailed views of distant galaxies.

Gaze into this deep portrait of our cosmos, where each point of light tells a story spanning billions of years. This vast cosmic tapestry serves as a time machine, capturing galaxies frozen in different chapters of our universe's evolution. In the foreground, we see mature galaxies with their graceful spiral arms and stately elliptical forms, while deeper in the field, more distant galaxies appear smaller and redder, their light having traveled billions of light-years to reach us. This single frame, containing thousands of galaxies at different distances, offers a precious scientific time capsule that allows astronomers to piece together the grand story of galactic evolution, revealing how today's intricate and ordered galaxies emerged from the chaos of the early universe.

Unlike observations that give us static snapshots of different galaxies at various cosmic epochs, simulations like IllustrisTNG TNG50 (see movie above) reveal the intricate dance of dark matter, gas, stars, and supermassive black holes across time. These digital laboratories recreate billions of years of cosmic evolution, showing us how the first primitive galaxies emerged from cosmic filaments of dark matter and gas, and how they transformed into the magnificent structures we see today. This virtual universe serves as a crucial bridge between theory and observation, allowing us to test our understanding of fundamental physics against the real cosmos. When simulation predictions match observational data, we gain confidence in our understanding; when they differ, these discrepancies point us toward new physics yet to be discovered. By comparing these simulated galaxies with our observations across cosmic time, we can unravel the complex physics driving galaxy evolution and piece together the complete story of how galaxies like our Milky Way came to be.

### + Formation of the first galaxies and physical conditions in the reionization epoch

The discovery and characterization of galaxies in the early universe, particularly during the epoch of reionization (z > 6), represents one of the most compelling frontiers in modern astronomy. While ground-based surveys and the Hubble Space Telescope have provided valuable insights into galaxy formation at z ∼ 6-8, our understanding of the earliest galaxies that emerged during the universe's first billion years has remained limited by observational capabilities. The launch of JWST has ushered in a transformative era in high-redshift galaxy studies, offering unprecedented sensitivity and resolution in the near- and mid-infrared wavelengths where these ancient galaxies' rest-frame ultraviolet and optical light is redshifted. JWST's remarkable capabilities have already led to the identification of numerous galaxy candidates at z > 10, challenging our existing models of early galaxy formation and evolution. Its advanced spectroscopic capabilities enable detailed studies of these galaxies' physical properties, providing crucial insights into how the first galaxies formed and contributed to cosmic reionization. 

In [Hsiao, Abdurro'uf et al. (2024)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...973....8H/abstract), we observed the lensed galaxy MACS0647-JD at z = 10.17 using JWST NIRSpec prism spectroscopy as part of GO 1433 (PI: Coe). This observation led to the detection of seven emission lines in the rest-frame UV and blue optical, representing some of the earliest detections of these lines at z > 10 and providing an unprecedented glimpse into the interstellar medium (ISM) conditions of the early universe. In [Abdurro'uf et al. (2024)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...973...47A/abstract), we revisited MACS0647-JD with NIRSpec high-resolution spectroscopy as part of GO 4246, which I led, successfully resolving multiple emission lines, including the critical [O II] λλ3726, 3729 doublet, a sensitive tracer of electron density in the ISM. This marked the first resolved detection of the [O II] doublet at z > 10, enabling the first direct measurement of electron density in a galaxy from the reionization era and offering valuable new insights into ISM conditions in an early galaxy.
