##### Abstract

We investigate a relation between surface densities of star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass (M*) at a ∼1 kpc scale namely spatially resolved star formation main sequence (SFMS) in massive (log (M*/M⊙) > 10.5) face-on disc galaxies at 0.01 < z < 0.02 and 0.8 < z < 1.8 and examine evolution of the relation. The spatially resolved SFMS of z ∼ 0 galaxies is discussed in a companion paper. For z ∼ 1 sample, we use eight bands imaging data set from Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey and 3D- HST and perform a pixel-to-pixel spectral energy distribution fitting to derive the spatially resolved SFR and M*. We find a linear spatially resolved SFMS in the z ∼ 1 galaxies that lie on the global SFMS, while a `flattening' at high Σ* end is found in that relation for the galaxies that lie below the global SFMS. Comparison with the spatially resolved SFMS of the z ∼ 0 galaxies shows smaller difference in the specific SFR (sSFR) at low Σ* than that at high Σ*. This trend is consistent with the evolution of the sSFR(r) radial profile, which shows a faster decrease in the central region than in the outskirt, agrees with the inside-out quenching scenario. We then derive an empirical model for the evolution of the Σ*(r), ΣSFR(r), and sSFR(r) radial profiles. Based on the empirical model, we estimate the radial profile of the quenching time-scale and reproduce the observed spatially resolved SFMS at z ∼ 1 and ∼0.
